Error using rng (line 108)
The current random number generator is the legacy generator.  This is because you have executed a command such as rand('state',0), which activates MATLAB's legacy random number behavior.  You may not use RNG to reseed the legacy random number generator.

Use rng('default') to reinitialize the random number generator to its startup configuration, or call RNG using a specific generator type, such as rng(seed,'twister').
